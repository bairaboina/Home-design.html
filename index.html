    <p>A house is a single-unit residential building, which may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.[1][2] Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space. Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers. Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room. A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room. Some large houses in North America have a recreation room. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans.</p>

1. Kitchen Influences Lifestyle
The way you use your kitchen can make a statement about your lifestyle. Decades ago, kitchens were often much smaller and only contained necessary cooking areas. Instead of it being a utilitarian room, it was utilized simply for preparing the meals and was often separated from the dining rooms to conceal the mess and smell left behind.
In more modern homes, kitchens are often larger and serve multiple purposes. For example, many homeowners have comfortable seating areas in their kitchens, as well as storage cabinets and even nooks or spaces for work units. You can now use your kitchen in a variety of ways that works best for you, and it is here to enhance your lifestyle, rather than become an obstacle for it.
2. Kitchens are Family Gathering Spaces
The kitchen wasn’t always the main hub of the home, but now it is becoming more and more that way. The kitchen is the most likely area for families to congregate, for people to discuss the details of their days with each other, and for guests and friends to spend time and hang out with their loved ones.
Most kitchens are equipped with enough room to fit multiple people, since it’s a much more popular space to spend time. Amenities like bar seating arrangements, as well as a larger area of flat working spaces with stone or quartz counter tops can provide multiple functions, inviting people to sit, stay, chat, do their work, and catch up on all the local news.
3. Kitchens are Evolving Spaces
As is evident from the paragraphs above, kitchens are dynamic spaces that continue to grow and evolve to change with the needs and lifestyles of the modern homeowner. A space that was once an afterthought for food preparation is now the main gathering hall for many families and friends.
